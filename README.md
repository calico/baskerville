# Baskerville

#### Sequential regulatory activity predictions with deep convolutional neural networks.

Baskerville provides researchers with tools to:

1. Train deep convolutional neural networks to predict regulatory activity along very long chromosome-scale DNA sequences
2. Score variants according to their predicted influence on regulatory activity across the sequence and/or for specific genes.
3. Annotate the specific nucleotides that drive regulatory element function.

### Installation

`git clone git@github.com:calico/baskerville.git`
`cd baskerville`
`pip install .`

To set up the required environment variables:
`cd baskerville`
`conda activate <conda_env>`
`./env_vars.sh`

*Note:* Change the two lines of code at the top of './env_vars.sh' to your username and local path.

Alternatively, the environment variables can be set manually:
```sh
export BASKERVILLE_DIR=/home/<user_path>/baskerville
export PATH=$BASKERVILLE_DIR/src/baskerville/scripts:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$BASKERVILLE_DIR/src/baskerville/scripts:$PYTHONPATH
```
