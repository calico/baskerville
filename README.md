# Baskerville

#### Sequential regulatory activity predictions with deep convolutional neural networks.

Baskerville provides researchers with tools to:

1. Train deep convolutional neural networks to predict regulatory activity along very long chromosome-scale DNA sequences
2. Score variants according to their predicted influence on regulatory activity across the sequence and/or for specific genes.
3. Annotate the specific nucleotides that drive regulatory element function.
